# Ignore Text Events

This isn't the prettiest Lua code you'll ever see however it does do the job and manages to stay in one easy to load/share/transfer file.

This only hooks the text events, not the server events themselves. This won't stop private message/notice/part behavior but will suppress the text events emitted from them.

This will kill/eat text events.

## Commands added

## Todo

-   Prevent adding the same event to the same context multiple times (return 'already added' message)
-   Sanitize event input against possible text events
-   Re-add version identifier upon reset
-   Properly remove pluginpref keys by setting them to nil
-   Confirm not going up against unhighlight -- if so, it's likely because of hooks being removed
