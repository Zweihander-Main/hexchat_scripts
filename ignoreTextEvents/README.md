# Ignore Text Events

This isn't the prettiest Lua code you'll ever see however it does do the job and manages to stay in one easy to load/share/transfer file.

This only hooks the text events, not the server events themselves. This won't stop private message/notice/part behavior but will suppress the text events emitted from them.

This will kill/eat text events.

DB get rid of in views/hooks?
