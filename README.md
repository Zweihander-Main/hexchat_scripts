# HexChat IRC Client Scripts

Each folder contains a different script for HexChat as well as a README describing how it works.

## List of Scripts

[Unhighlight Channels](./unhighlightChannels/) -- converts highlights from user-selected channels to regular non-highlighted text events

## Installation

For installation: `Window` > `Plugins and Scripts` will allow you to load and unload them. See [the official documentation](https://hexchat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-do-i-auto-load-scripts-at-startup) on how to load scripts automatically at startup.

## Todo

-   Future script: Ignore private messages from users matching x both globally and maybe per network
-   Future script: Ignore selected text events per channel
