# ignoreNotifications.lua

This script adds in a menu under `Settings` called `Ignoring Notifications`. You can select `Ignore Current Channel` to ignore notifications from the currently selected channel and then select that channel under `Currently Ignored Channels` to unignore it. 

Note that notifications being ignored include `Channel Msg Hilight` and `Channel Action Hilight` text events. 

Also note that the notifications are converted into their non-notification counterparts (`Channel Message` and `Channel Action`). The messages are not removed entirely, simply converted.
